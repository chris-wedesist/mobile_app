# Emergency Feature Implementation

I need you to implement an emergency response feature for this React Native mobile app.

## Context:

This is a personal safety app with emergency response capabilities including:

- Panic button functionality
- GPS location tracking
- Emergency contact notification
- Stealth mode features
- Incident reporting

## Requirements:

{{input}}

## Implementation Guidelines:

- Follow React Native and Expo best practices
- Ensure robust error handling for critical safety features
- Consider offline functionality where possible
- Implement proper state management
- Add comprehensive TypeScript types
- Include accessibility features
- Consider battery optimization
- Handle network connectivity issues gracefully

## Key Considerations:

- **Reliability**: Emergency features must work under stress
- **Privacy**: Protect user location and personal data
- **Performance**: Quick response times are critical
- **Cross-platform**: Must work on both iOS and Android
- **Background execution**: Some features may need background processing

Please implement the feature with these priorities in mind, creating or modifying multiple files as needed.
