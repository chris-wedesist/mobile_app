# React Native Component Refactor

Please refactor the selected React Native component to improve:

## Objectives:

- **Accessibility**: Add proper accessibility props for screen readers
- **Type Safety**: Ensure proper TypeScript typing
- **Mobile UX**: Follow React Native best practices for mobile interactions
- **Code Organization**: Improve component structure and readability

## Specific Considerations:

- Use React Native's StyleSheet for styling
- Consider iOS and Android platform differences
- Optimize for touch interactions
- Ensure proper keyboard handling
- Handle different screen sizes and orientations
- Consider performance on lower-end devices
