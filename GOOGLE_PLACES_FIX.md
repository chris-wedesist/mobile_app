# Google Places API Configuration Fix

## Issue Fixed
The Google Places API integration was continuously failing with the error message "Google Places API 'not configured'" despite the API key being present in the environment variables.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by several configuration problems:

1. **Duplicate `extra` entries in app.json**: The `app.json` file contained duplicate `extra` configurations (lines 18-20 and 52-54), which could cause configuration conflicts.

2. **JSON syntax error**: There was a trailing comma on line 55 of `app.json` that made the JSON invalid.

3. **Incorrect environment variable access**: The code was trying to access environment variables using `process.env` directly, which doesn't work reliably in Expo client-side code.

4. **Insufficient error handling**: The API validation and error messages were not detailed enough to identify the specific configuration issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed app.json Configuration
- Removed duplicate `extra` entries
- Fixed JSON syntax error (trailing comma)
- Ensured single, clean configuration block

### 2. Updated Environment Variable Access
**Before:**
```typescript
const GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY || '';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

const GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY = Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY || 
                             process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY || '';
```

### 3. Enhanced Validation and Error Handling
- Improved `isGooglePlacesAvailable()` function with better validation logic
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Enhanced error messages for API calls
- Added specific handling for different API response statuses (`REQUEST_DENIED`, `ZERO_RESULTS`, etc.)

### 4. Added Diagnostic Tools
- Created `scripts/validate-google-places.js` for configuration validation
- Added comprehensive debugging output
- Provided troubleshooting guidance

## Files Modified

1. **`app.json`**
   - Removed duplicate `extra` entries
   - Fixed JSON syntax

2. **`lib/googlePlacesAPI.ts`**
   - Added expo-constants import
   - Updated environment variable access method
   - Enhanced validation logic
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Added detailed API response handling

3. **`scripts/validate-google-places.js`** (new file)
   - Configuration validation tool
   - Troubleshooting guidance
   - Environment checking

## Verification

The fix has been tested and verified to:
- ✅ Properly load the API key from expo-constants
- ✅ Validate API key format correctly
- ✅ Return `true` for `isGooglePlacesAvailable()`
- ✅ Handle missing API keys gracefully
- ✅ Provide detailed error messages for debugging

## Usage

To validate the configuration after deployment:
```bash
node scripts/validate-google-places.js
```

## Expected Behavior

After this fix:
- The "Google Places API 'not configured'" error should be resolved
- The app should successfully connect to Google Places API
- Attorney search functionality should work properly
- Detailed logging will help with any future troubleshooting

## Google Cloud Requirements

Ensure the following are configured in Google Cloud Console:
1. Places API is enabled
2. Billing is set up
3. API key restrictions allow the app's usage
4. No quota limits are exceeded
