- **Caching Strategy**: AsyncStorage for offline incident viewing
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and state management

### Security Metrics
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for all sensitive content
- **Rate Limiting**: 3 submissions/hour prevents spam
- **Content Validation**: Security scoring system (0-100 scale)
- **Privacy Protection**: Anonymous reporting and location accuracy controls

## üîó Integration Points

### Required Dependencies
```json
{
  "expo-location": "Location services for incident positioning",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "Encrypted local storage",
  "react-native-maps": "Interactive map visualization"
}
```

### Service Integration
```typescript
// Initialize services
const encryptionService = new EncryptionService(config);
const incidentService = new IncidentService(encryptionService);

// Use in components
<IncidentSubmissionForm encryptionService={encryptionService} />
<IncidentMapView encryptionService={encryptionService} />
```

## üì± User Experience Features

### Accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: All components support assistive technology
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **High Contrast**: Support for accessibility contrast modes
- **Dynamic Text**: Respects system font size settings

### Offline Support
- **Form Completion**: Users can fill forms offline
- **Data Sync**: Submissions queue for later sync when online
- **Cached Viewing**: Previously loaded incidents available offline
- **Progressive Loading**: Graceful degradation for poor connectivity

### Error Handling
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Fallback States**: Graceful handling of service unavailability
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear feedback during operations

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

### Data Protection
```typescript
// All sensitive data is encrypted
const encryptedDescription = await encryptionService.encrypt(description);

// Location privacy protection
if (locationAccuracy > THRESHOLD) {
  warnings.push('Location accuracy is low');
}

// Rate limiting protection
if (submissions >= MAX_PER_HOUR) {
  return rateLimitError;
}
```

### Content Validation
```typescript
// Security scoring system
let securityScore = 100;

// Check for suspicious patterns
if (containsSuspiciousWords(content)) {
  securityScore -= 20;
  warnings.push('Content may require verification');
}

// Location accuracy validation
if (locationAccuracy > 100) {
  securityScore -= 10;
}
```
