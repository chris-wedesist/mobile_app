# Real API Integration for Attorney Data

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of real API integration for attorney data fetching in the DESIST mobile application. **All fake/generated data has been completely removed** and replaced with real, verified attorney information from legitimate sources.

## üõ°Ô∏è Trust & Verification

### Core Principles
- **ZERO fake data**: No generated attorney profiles, names, or contact information
- **Verified sources only**: All data comes from legitimate legal organizations
- **Transparent when unavailable**: Clear messaging when no attorneys are found
- **User trust first**: Maintains complete trust in critical legal situations

### Verification Fields
Every attorney record includes:
- `verified: boolean` - Confirms attorney is verified by source
- `source: string` - Identifies which organization verified the attorney
- `lastVerified: string` - Date of last verification

## üìÅ File Structure

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ attorneys.ts              # Main attorney data service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stateBarAPI.ts           # State bar association APIs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ legalAidAPI.ts           # Legal aid organization APIs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ civilRightsAPI.ts        # Civil rights organization APIs
```

## üîß API Configuration

### Rate Limiting
- **State Bar APIs**: 40-100 requests per hour
- **LSC API**: 100 requests per hour
- **Civil Rights APIs**: 25-50 requests per hour
- **Cache duration**: 30 minutes

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Empty array returns instead of fake data
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

## üöÄ Implementation Details

### Main Attorney Service (`lib/attorneys.ts`)
```typescript
export const getAttorneys = async (
  latitude: number,
  longitude: number,
  radius: number = 25
): Promise<Attorney[]>
```

**Features**:
- Location-based search across all sources
- Automatic state/territory detection
- Duplicate removal and filtering
- Distance calculation and sorting
- Civil rights specialization prioritization

### State Bar API Service (`lib/stateBarAPI.ts`)
```typescript
export const searchStateBarAttorneys = async (
  stateCode: string,
  latitude: number,
  longitude: number,
  radius: number,
  specializations: string[]
): Promise<Attorney[]>
```

### Legal Aid API Service (`lib/legalAidAPI.ts`)
```typescript
export const searchLSCAttorneys = async (
  latitude: number,
  longitude: number,
  radius: number,
  specializations: string[]
): Promise<Attorney[]>
```

### Civil Rights API Service (`lib/civilRightsAPI.ts`)
```typescript
export const searchACLUAttorneys = async (
  latitude: number,
  longitude: number,
  radius: number,
  specializations: string[]
): Promise<Attorney[]>
```
