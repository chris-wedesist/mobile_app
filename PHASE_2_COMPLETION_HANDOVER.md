### Testing Infrastructure Needed

1. **Physical Devices**: iOS and Android devices with biometric capabilities
2. **Testing Accounts**: Test emergency contacts and messaging services
3. **Debugging Tools**: For monitoring security system behavior
4. **Performance Monitoring**: To track impact of security features

## 🔧 Known Issues & Considerations

### Development Environment Issues
- **Expo Go Loading Errors**: Development server runs but Expo Go has persistent loading issues
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Some routing type issues exist but don't affect functionality
- **Testing Limitations**: Cannot validate device-specific features without physical testing

### Implementation Notes
- All security managers use singleton patterns for consistent state
- Error handling is comprehensive but needs real-world validation
- Performance impact of security features is theoretical until tested
- Emergency protocols need real phone number testing

## 📋 Handover Checklist for Developer

### Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Set up physical testing devices (iOS with Face ID/Touch ID, Android with fingerprint)
- [ ] Configure test emergency contacts and phone numbers
- [ ] Test biometric authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Validate screen protection on multiple devices
- [ ] Test emergency protocols with real contacts

### Code Review Areas
- [ ] Review all security manager implementations for edge cases
- [ ] Validate error handling in all authentication flows
- [ ] Check performance impact of continuous threat monitoring
- [ ] Review emergency protocol safety measures

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Create comprehensive test plan for each security feature
- [ ] Set up automated testing where possible
- [ ] Document all testing scenarios and expected behaviors
- [ ] Create bug reporting and tracking system

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Monitor app startup time with security features enabled
- [ ] Test memory usage during security scanning
- [ ] Validate battery impact of continuous monitoring
- [ ] Check network usage for any external communications

## 🔄 Next Steps: Phase 3 Preparation

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

1. **Real Device Testing**: Phase 2 success depends entirely on thorough device testing
2. **Emergency Protocol Safety**: Emergency features must be tested with real contacts
3. **Performance Validation**: Security features must not significantly impact app performance
4. **User Experience**: Security should enhance, not hinder, user experience
5. **Error Recovery**: All failure modes must be gracefully handled

**The Phase 2 implementation is architecturally sound and feature-complete. Success now depends on comprehensive real-world testing and validation.**
